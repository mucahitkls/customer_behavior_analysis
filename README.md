# Customer Behavior Analysis Tool (Development Stage)

## Overview
The Customer Behavior Analysis Tool is an experimental project aimed at providing insightful analyses of customer behaviors based on their transactional and demographic data. This tool is currently under development and is intended to evolve into a fully functioning application that assists businesses in making data-driven decisions.

## Project Status
This project is in its early stages and is considered a work-in-progress. Key functionalities related to data loading, cleaning, and analysis are under active development. Users and contributors should note that the tool is experimental and subject to significant changes.

## Objective
The primary objective is to develop a robust and flexible tool that can:
- Load and clean various customer-related datasets.
- Analyze customer behavior to identify trends, patterns, and segments.
- Provide actionable insights through reports and visualizations.

## Frameworks and Libraries Used
- **Python:** The primary programming language used for development.
- **Pandas:** Utilized for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** Employed for numerical computations.
- **Faker:** Used to generate dummy data for testing and development purposes.

## OOP Design Principles
The tool is being developed with a strong emphasis on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure code modularity, reusability, and maintainability. Key principles include:
- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each class and method has a single, focused responsibility.
- **Open/Closed Principle:** The system is open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle:** Derived classes can be used as their base classes.
- **Interface Segregation Principle:** Interfaces are specific to client requirements.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle:** Depend on abstractions, not concretions.

## Current Features (Under Development)
- Data loading from CSV and Excel files.
- Basic data cleaning operations, including handling missing values and standardizing entries.
- Initial implementation of analysis methods.

## How to Contribute
As this is an experimental project, contributions, suggestions, and feedback are highly welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests. You can also open issues to discuss potential features or report bugs.
